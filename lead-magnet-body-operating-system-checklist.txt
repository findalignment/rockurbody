THE BODY OPERATING SYSTEM CHECKLIST
================================================================================

A 10-item self-assessment to evaluate how well your body's systems are 
functioning. Get clarity on what's working, what's not, and what needs 
upgrading.

================================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS
================================================================================

✓ Many people don't realize how their body's limitations affect daily life 
  until they assess systematically

✓ Catch imbalances and restrictions before they become bigger problems or 
  injuries

✓ Understand what needs attention and prioritize your body's upgrade path

✓ Use this as a baseline to track improvements as you upgrade your body's 
  software

YOUR BODY'S OPERATING SYSTEM NEEDS ATTENTION

You're experiencing significant limitations in how your body functions. 
Multiple systems are not operating optimally, which likely affects your daily 
life, performance, and long-term health.

A Body Systems Check would be highly valuable. We'll identify the root causes 
of these limitations and create a clear roadmap for upgrading your body's 
software.

YOUR BODY'S OPERATING SYSTEM HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

Some systems are working well, but others need attention. You may be 
compensating for limitations without realizing it, which can lead to problems 
over time.

A Body Systems Check would help identify which systems need the most attention 
and prioritize your upgrade path.
