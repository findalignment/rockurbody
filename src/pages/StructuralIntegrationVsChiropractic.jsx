                  Chiropractic: Joint-Focused
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Chiropractors work primarily with joints.especially the spine. They use adjustments (quick, controlled force) to restore proper joint movement and alignment.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>The theory:</strong> When joints are misaligned or not moving properly, it affects the nervous system and creates pain/dysfunction. Restoring proper joint function improves nervous system communication.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Results:</strong> Often immediate relief. Great for acute issues. Many people need ongoing maintenance to maintain results.

                  Structural Integrators work with fascia.the connective tissue that wraps everything in your body. Through sustained manual pressure and movement education, we reorganize your structure.

                  <strong>The theory:</strong> Chronic pain and dysfunction come from fascial restrictions and poor movement patterns built up over years. To create lasting change, we need to address the whole system, not just individual joints.

                  Absolutely. Many people use chiropractic for acute issues and maintenance, then do a series of Structural Integration when they want deeper, lasting change. The approaches can complement each other.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Not necessarily. If chiropractic is working for you, great! But if you've been getting adjusted regularly and the same issues keep returning, that might indicate a need for fascial work and movement retraining.

                  Does Structural Integration involve "cracking" or adjustments?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  No. There are no quick, forceful movements. The work is slow, sustained pressure on fascia combined with movement. Sometimes joints will release or make sounds, but that's not the goal.it's a side effect of tissue releasing.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  It depends on the cause. If your pain is from a specific joint dysfunction, chiropractic may help. If it's from fascial restrictions, postural imbalances, or movement patterns (most chronic pain), Structural Integration addresses root causes.

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Different training and philosophy. Chiropractors specialize in spinal manipulation and joint function. Structural Integrators specialize in fascial work and whole-body structure. Both are valuable.just different approaches.

            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Chiropractic is great for joint-focused care and maintenance. Structural Integration is ideal for whole-body structural change and addressing chronic patterns.

            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed">
              If you've been getting adjusted regularly but your issues keep returning, it might be time to address the fascial system and movement patterns. That's where I come in.
