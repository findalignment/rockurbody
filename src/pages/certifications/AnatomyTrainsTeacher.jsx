              Why This Training Matters to You
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Most bodyworkers treat muscles as individual parts. But your body doesn't work that way. Your fascia connects everything in continuous lines that run throughout your entire body. Understanding these connections (myofascial meridians) is the difference between temporary relief and lasting structural change.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I've been trained directly by Tom Myers, the creator of Anatomy Trains, and have assisted and co-taught in multiple Anatomy Trains courses. This isn't something I learned from a book or online course. I've spent hundreds of hours learning this system directly from the source.

              Being an Anatomy Trains Teacher in Training means I understand how your body actually works as an integrated whole.

              What Is Anatomy Trains?
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Anatomy Trains is a revolutionary way of understanding human anatomy based on how fascia (connective tissue) actually connects throughout your body. Instead of seeing muscles as separate units, we see them as part of continuous fascial lines (myofascial meridians) that run from head to toe.

                  Tom Myers mapped out 12 major fascial lines that connect your body:

                  <li>• <strong>Lateral Line</strong> - Runs up each side for stability</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Spiral Line</strong> - Wraps body in double helix for rotation</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Arm Lines</strong> (4 lines) - Deep/superficial, front/back of arms</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Functional Lines</strong> - Connect limbs to opposite sides</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Deep Front Line</strong> - Core of body, connects breathing to support</li>

                  Tom Myers is the originator of Anatomy Trains. He spent decades researching, dissecting, and mapping the fascial system. Learning directly from him means learning the system as it was intended, with all the nuance and depth that comes from the source.

                  I haven't just taken Anatomy Trains courses. I've assisted Tom in teaching them, working hands-on with students, helping refine their understanding and technique. This level of involvement means I understand this work at a teaching level, not just a practitioner level.

                  Very few practitioners are invited to train as Anatomy Trains teachers. This distinction means I've demonstrated deep understanding of the system and am being mentored to teach it to others. You're getting work from someone who will eventually teach this to other practitioners.
