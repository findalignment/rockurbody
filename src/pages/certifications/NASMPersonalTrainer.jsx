              Why NASM Certification Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Anyone can call themselves a personal trainer. But NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine) certification means I've completed rigorous training in exercise science, biomechanics, program design, and safety. More importantly, NASM's approach is built on corrective exercise and injury prevention, not just making you sweat.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              NASM is one of the most respected certifications in the fitness industry. It's the gold standard for trainers who want to work with real people who have real limitations, not just young athletes who can handle anything.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-accent font-semibold">
              NASM training means I know how to train you safely and effectively, regardless of your starting point or limitations.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Unlike many certifications that focus purely on exercise performance, NASM is built around corrective exercise. The entire methodology starts with assessment, identifies dysfunction, and addresses it before loading it with weight. This is why NASM trainers can work effectively with people who have pain or limitations.

                  NASM uses a systematic, progressive training model with five phases: Stabilization, Strength Endurance, Hypertrophy, Maximal Strength, and Power. Not everyone needs all five phases. I use this model to meet you where you are and progress you intelligently.
