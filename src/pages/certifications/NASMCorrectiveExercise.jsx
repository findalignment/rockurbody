              Why This Specialization Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Basic personal training teaches you how to make people stronger. But what about people who move poorly? Who have pain? Who've developed compensation patterns from years of sitting or old injuries? That's where corrective exercise comes in.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The NASM Corrective Exercise Specialist (CES) certification teaches advanced assessment techniques and corrective strategies for movement dysfunction. This isn't about making workouts harder. It's about making movement better.

              This specialization means I can work with people others can't help.

                  I learn to identify which muscles are overactive (tight and dominant) and which are underactive (weak and inhibited). This is critical because you can't just strengthen everything. Some muscles need to be released and inhibited before others can activate properly.

                <strong className="text-neutralDark">If you have chronic pain:</strong> I can identify which movement dysfunctions are creating or perpetuating your pain. Knee pain might be from weak glutes and overactive hip flexors. Shoulder pain from poor scapular control. I find the root cause and address it systematically.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed">
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">If you've had injuries:</strong> Old injuries create compensation patterns. You stop using certain muscles, others take over, and years later you have pain somewhere else. Corrective exercise addresses these patterns before they become new injuries.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed">
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">If traditional training hasn't worked:</strong> Maybe you've tried working out but certain exercises hurt, or you plateau quickly, or you keep getting injured. This usually means underlying movement dysfunction. We address that first, then training becomes effective.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed">
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">If you sit all day:</strong> Desk work creates predictable dysfunctions: tight hip flexors, weak glutes, forward head posture, overactive upper traps. Corrective exercise systematically reverses these patterns.
