              What is MovNat?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              MovNat (Natural Movement) is a physical education system based on how humans evolved to move. Walking, running, jumping, balancing, crawling, climbing, lifting, carrying, throwing, catching, swimming, and defending. These are the movement patterns humans developed over millions of years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Modern fitness focuses on isolated muscles and machine-based exercises. MovNat focuses on integrated, practical movements that build real-world capability. You're not just strong in the gym. You're capable in life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-accent font-semibold">
              MovNat Level 2 certification means I can teach complex, challenging natural movement skills safely and progressively.

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">With Structural Integration:</strong> MovNat movements require good mobility and structural balance. Structural work creates the capacity for better movement. MovNat trains the patterns. Together, they build capable, resilient bodies.

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">With traditional strength training:</strong> MovNat isn't a replacement for strength training. It's a complement. Strength training builds capacity. MovNat applies that capacity to practical movement skills.

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">With corrective exercise:</strong> MovNat naturally addresses many movement dysfunctions because it requires full-body coordination and control. Combined with targeted corrective work, it's extremely effective.
