              Why Specialized Training Matters for Parkinson's
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurological condition affecting movement, balance, coordination, and motor control. But here's what many people don't know: exercise is one of the most effective interventions for managing Parkinson's symptoms and slowing progression.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Generic exercise programs don't address the specific challenges of Parkinson's. MedFit Parkinson's Disease Fitness Specialist certification trains me to design and implement safe, effective exercise programs specifically for people with Parkinson's. This includes understanding the disease progression, medication timing, fall risk management, and which types of exercise provide the most benefit.

              Exercise isn't just helpful for Parkinson's. It's essential.
