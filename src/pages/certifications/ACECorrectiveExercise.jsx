              Why Corrective Exercise Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Most people are moving poorly. Sitting all day creates tight hip flexors, weak glutes, and forward head posture. Old injuries create compensations. Athletic training creates overuse patterns. The result? Movement dysfunctions that eventually become pain, injury, or performance limitations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              ACE Corrective Exercise Specialist (CES) certification trains me to systematically identify these dysfunctions, understand what's causing them, and design specific corrective exercise programs to address them. Not generic stretching. Targeted corrective work based on assessment.

                  Systematic evaluation of how you move. Overhead squat assessment, gait analysis, single-leg balance, push/pull patterns. Identifying where you compensate, where you're restricted, and where you're weak. The assessment reveals the underlying issues.

                  Understanding which muscles are overactive (tight, facilitated) and which are underactive (weak, inhibited). For example, tight hip flexors often inhibit glutes. The corrective approach addresses both sides of the imbalance.

                  A systematic four-step approach: Inhibit (release overactive muscles), Lengthen (stretch tight tissues), Activate (wake up underactive muscles), Integrate (retrain proper movement patterns). This sequence addresses dysfunction at multiple levels.

                <strong className="text-neutralDark">Identify what's actually wrong:</strong> Most people know they have pain or limitations but don't know why. Corrective exercise assessment reveals the underlying dysfunctions. Once you understand the problem, you can address it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">Targeted solutions:</strong> No generic "stretch and strengthen." Specific corrective exercises based on your individual dysfunctions. This is why some people improve quickly while others struggle. Targeted work gets results.

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">Prevent injury:</strong> Addressing dysfunctions before they become injuries. This is especially valuable for athletes or anyone doing intense training. Better movement = fewer injuries.

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">Improve performance:</strong> You can't perform well if you're compensating. Address the dysfunction, improve the movement, unlock better performance.

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">Lasting results:</strong> Corrective exercise retrains movement patterns. This creates lasting change because you're teaching your body better ways to move.
