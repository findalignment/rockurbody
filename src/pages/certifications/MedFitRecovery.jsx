              Why Fitness Matters in Recovery
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Addiction changes your brain chemistry, disrupts your nervous system, and leaves you disconnected from your body. Recovery isn't just about stopping substance use. It's about rebuilding your relationship with yourself, including your physical body.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              MedFit Drug & Alcohol Recovery Fitness Specialist certification trains me to understand the specific needs of people in recovery and design exercise programs that support sobriety, rebuild physical health, and provide a healthy outlet for stress and emotions.

              Exercise isn't just good for your body. It's part of rebuilding your life.

                  How addiction affects the brain's reward system, dopamine regulation, stress response, and physical health. Understanding the stages of recovery and common challenges (cravings, stress, depression, anxiety).

                  Research on how exercise supports recovery: improving mood through natural endorphin release, rebuilding dopamine pathways, reducing stress and anxiety, improving sleep, and providing structure and positive routine.

                  Many people in recovery have trust issues, body image concerns, or trauma histories. Creating a safe, non-judgmental training environment. Meeting clients where they are without expectations or pressure.

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Exercise releases endorphins, improves dopamine regulation, and creates natural "feel good" chemistry. This helps address the mood issues common in early recovery without substances.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Stress is a major relapse trigger. Exercise provides a healthy outlet for stress, regulates cortisol, and improves stress resilience. Physical activity becomes a coping tool.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Recovery thrives on structure. Regular exercise sessions create routine, accountability, and a sense of purpose. You have somewhere to be and something positive to do.

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Addiction disconnects you from your physical self. Movement training helps you feel your body again, notice sensations, build awareness, and rebuild trust in your physical capabilities.

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Recovery requires believing you can change. Exercise provides tangible evidence that you can improve, get stronger, and achieve goals. This builds confidence that carries into other areas of recovery.

                  Sleep disturbances are common in early recovery. Regular exercise improves sleep quality, helping you feel better and reducing relapse risk.
