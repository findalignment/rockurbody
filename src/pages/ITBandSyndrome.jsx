              That Stabbing Pain on the Outside of Your Knee
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              It started a few miles into your run. Sharp pain on the outside of your knee. You tried to push through it, but it got worse. Now it hurts every time you run, especially going downhill. Sometimes even walking down stairs triggers it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You've been foam rolling your IT band religiously. It's incredibly painful, but you've been told this is how you fix it. Weeks of brutal foam rolling later, the pain is still there. Maybe you've tried rest. The pain goes away, but returns the moment you start running again.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-accent font-semibold">
              Here's the truth: Your IT band isn't the problem. It's the victim. And foam rolling it is mostly pointless.

              What Actually Causes IT Band Syndrome
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Your IT band (iliotibial band) is a thick strip of fascia running from your hip down the outside of your thigh to just below your knee. It doesn't really "get tight" in the way muscles do. It's a stabilizing structure, not a muscle.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              <strong className="text-neutralDark">The real issue:</strong> IT band syndrome (ITBS) is almost always caused by weakness and poor mechanics at the hip, creating excessive friction where the IT band crosses your knee.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6">
              <div className="border-l-4 border-sage pl-6">

                  Weak Glutes (Especially Glute Medius)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Your glute medius stabilizes your pelvis when you're on one leg (like when running). When it's weak, your hip drops on the non-weight-bearing side. This creates a chain reaction: your femur rotates inward, increasing tension on the IT band, and creating friction at the knee. This is the primary cause of ITBS.
                </p>

                  Hip Adductor Tightness
                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Tight inner thigh muscles (adductors) pull your femur into internal rotation and adduction. Your IT band and hip abductors (TFL and glutes) have to fight against this constantly, creating overuse and irritation.
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Your TFL (tensor fasciae latae) is a small hip flexor/abductor muscle that connects to the IT band. When your glutes are weak, your TFL compensates and becomes overactive and tight. This increases tension on the IT band. Releasing the TFL is important, but strengthening glutes is more important.

              Why Foam Rolling Your IT Band Doesn't Work

              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">Your IT band is incredibly tough:</strong> It's designed to be a strong, stable structure. The amount of force needed to actually change its length or tension would require thousands of pounds of pressure. You're not creating meaningful tissue change with a foam roller.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">It's not really "tight":</strong> The IT band doesn't have muscle fibers. It can't contract and relax like a muscle. The perceived "tightness" is actually increased tension from other structures (TFL, weak glutes, poor mechanics) pulling on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">You're treating the symptom, not the cause:</strong> Even if foam rolling provided temporary relief (by stimulating nerves or reducing perceived tightness), you haven't addressed why the IT band is under excessive tension in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-neutralDark">What does help:</strong> Releasing your TFL, adductors, and hip flexors. Strengthening your glutes. Fixing your running mechanics. Addressing the actual problems.
