            <strong>Structural Integration</strong> is precise hands-on work that helps your body's connective tissue (fascia) glide and coordinate better. It's not massage‚Äîit's systematic bodywork that reorganizes how your whole body functions.

              What It Is
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Your body is wrapped in a web of connective tissue called fascia. Think of it like a three-dimensional sweater‚Äîwhen one part gets tight or restricted, it pulls on everything else. Over time, compensations stack up, and you end up with pain, stiffness, or movement limitations that won't budge with stretching or strength training alone.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Structural Integration addresses the fascia directly. Through skilled hands-on work, I release restrictions and help your body reorganize around better alignment. I pair this with simple movement cues, so the changes "stick" when you stand, walk, lift, and live.
