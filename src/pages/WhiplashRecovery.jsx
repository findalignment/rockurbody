              The Accident Was Months Ago. Why Does Your Neck Still Hurt?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The initial pain might have faded, but something's not right. Your neck is stiff. Turning your head fully feels impossible. You get headaches. Your shoulders are constantly tight. Maybe your low back started hurting too, even though that wasn't injured.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutralDark/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You've done physical therapy. Maybe chiropractic adjustments. Some things helped initially, but you've plateaued. You're better than right after the accident, but you're not back to normal. You're starting to accept this might be permanent.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-accent font-semibold">
              It doesn't have to be. Whiplash creates whole-body compensation patterns that need specific work to resolve.

              What Actually Happens in Whiplash
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-neutralDark/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              In a car accident, your body gets violently accelerated then decelerated. Your head whips forward and back (or side to side). This creates micro-tears in muscles, ligaments, and fascia throughout your neck, shoulders, and upper back.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6">
              <div className="border-l-4 border-sage pl-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutralDark mb-2">
                  Initial Injury (0-6 weeks)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Inflammation, pain, muscle guarding. Your body protects the injured area by splinting it with muscle tension. This is normal and appropriate initially.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="border-l-4 border-accent pl-6">

                  Compensation Phase (6 weeks - 6 months)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  As tissues heal, scar tissue forms. Your nervous system adapts to avoid painful movements. You develop compensatory movement patterns. Your fascia becomes dense and restricted. What started as acute injury becomes chronic dysfunction.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6">

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Compensation patterns are now ingrained. Limited neck rotation becomes your new normal. Shoulder tension is constant. You might develop headaches, jaw problems, or low back pain as your whole body adapts to the neck restriction.

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Physical therapy typically addresses the neck directly with exercises and stretches. This helps, but it misses the whole-body fascial restrictions and compensation patterns that developed.

                <p className="text-neutralDark/80">
                  Adjusting joints that are locked up by fascial restrictions often provides only temporary relief. The fascial restriction pulls the joint back out of alignment.

                  General relaxation massage can temporarily reduce tension but doesn't address the specific fascial restrictions, scar tissue, or movement pattern dysfunction from whiplash.
