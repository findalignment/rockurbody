                If you've tried everything to resolve chronic pain, improve your posture, or enhance your physical performance (massage, chiropractic adjustments, physical therapy), you might still feel like something is missing. That's because most approaches treat symptoms in isolation rather than addressing the root cause: how your entire body is organized in space and how you've learned to move through the world.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Rock takes a fundamentally different approach, one that combines two powerful modalities that amplify each other's effectiveness: <strong>Structural Integration</strong> and <strong>Movement Education</strong>. This integrated methodology doesn't just provide temporary relief, it creates lasting transformation by addressing both the structure of your body and the patterns that shape how you use it.

                  What Makes Rock Different
                </h3>

                <div className="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 shadow-sm mb-8">
                  <h4 className="text-2xl font-heading text-neutralDark mb-4">
                    A Progressive, Systematic Approach
                  </h4>
                  <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Unlike one-off massage sessions or generic personal training, Rock offers a <strong>comprehensive 12-session protocol</strong> that systematically works through your entire body. Based on Anatomy Trains Structural Integration and Tom Myers' myofascial maps, each session builds upon the last, progressively releasing tension, restoring natural alignment, and unlocking freedom in layers, from the superficial fascia to the deep core structures.
                  </p>
                  <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    This isn't about chasing pain from one area to another. It's about understanding your body as an interconnected whole and addressing the entire system.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 shadow-sm">
                  <h4 className="text-2xl font-heading text-neutralDark mb-4">
                    The Missing Link: Movement Education
                  </h4>
                  <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Here's where Rock truly differentiates himself: structural integration alone can create profound changes, but without teaching you <em>how to inhabit</em> that new structure, old movement patterns inevitably return.
                  </p>
                  <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    This is why Rock's sessions aren't just about hands-on work—they're about education. It's not just changing <em>what</em> you feel in your body, it's changing <em>how</em> you perceive it (interoception) and <em>how</em> you move through space (proprioception). Movement education isn't an add-on; it's woven into the process. While structural integration reorganizes your body's architecture, movement education and proprioception allows you how to inhabit that new structure. It changes how you move, breathe, and carry yourself—making the work sustainable rather than reverting to old dysfunction.
