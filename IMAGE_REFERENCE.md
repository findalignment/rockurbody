## Format Notes

- **All images should have both JPG and WebP versions**
  - Example: `about-hero.jpg` and `about-hero.webp`
  - WebP is used for modern browsers, JPG as fallback
- **Recommended sizes:**
  - Hero images: 1920px wide minimum (landscape orientation)
  - Portrait images: 400px x 400px or larger
  - Maintain aspect ratio of approximately 16:9 for hero images
- **Current images in `/public/` folder:**
  - All existing images have both `.jpg` and `.webp` versions
  - Images should be optimized for web (compressed appropriately)

## Priority Images Needed

These pages were recently created and need proper hero images:

1. **gravity-structural-integration-hero** - Image showing balanced posture or SI work
2. **exercise-for-life-hero** - Functional movement, real-world activity
3. **safe-gym-training-hero** - Training with proper form
4. **daily-mobility-hero** - Mobility/stretching work

## How to Use This Reference

1. In your Airtable "Site Images" base, the **Name** field should match the "Airtable Name" column
2. Upload both JPG and WebP versions of each image
3. Follow the naming convention exactly (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)
4. Store images in the `/public/` folder (root) or `/public/images/` folder
5. Reference images in code as `/filename.jpg` or `/images/filename.jpg`

## Image Optimization Script

To convert images to WebP format, use the provided script:
```bash
cd /Users/rockhudson/Desktop/rockurbody
./optimize-images.sh
```

This will create WebP versions of all JPG/PNG files in the public directory.
