## Offer 2: Software Upgrade Plan (4-8 Week Block)

### Who It's For
- People ready to commit to a systematic transformation
- Those with chronic tension, pain, or movement restrictions that need systematic attention
- Anyone who wants lasting change, not temporary relief
- People willing to do light homework between sessions to reinforce changes

### What Happens
A focused 4-8 week program that systematically upgrades your body's software:

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation**
- Release major restrictions and imbalances through structural work
- Begin teaching your body new ways to organize itself through movement education
- You'll notice immediate changes: easier breathing, less tension, improved range of motion

**Weeks 3-4: Integration**
- Build on the foundation, addressing deeper patterns
- Refine movement quality as your body starts to "remember" new patterns
- Movement feels smoother, strength improves, old compensations begin to fade

**Weeks 5-8: Refinement**
- Fine-tune the system, address remaining restrictions
- Build movement patterns that support your upgraded structure long-term
- Changes feel automatic—your body operates differently with better alignment and less effort

### What You Leave With
- **Upgraded Structure** - Your body is better aligned, with restrictions released and fascial patterns reorganized. Movement happens from a stronger foundation.
- **New Movement Patterns** - You've learned how to move in ways that support your upgraded structure. These patterns become automatic.
- **Self-Maintenance Tools** - Specific exercises and practices to maintain improvements and continue upgrading over time.
- **Lasting Change** - The changes hold because they're built into your movement patterns, not just applied from the outside.

### Typical Cadence
1-2 sessions per week for 4-8 weeks, depending on your schedule and goals:
- **Structural Integration sessions:** 60-120 minutes
- **Movement Education sessions:** 60-90 minutes
- **Combined sessions:** 90-120 minutes

Between sessions: Light homework (specific movements or practices) to reinforce what we've worked on.

### Investment
**$1,200-$3,000** (varies based on session types and frequency)
